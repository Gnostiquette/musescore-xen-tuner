# NEJI (Near-equal just intonation)

(aka quasi-equal rational tuning)

[Read about NEJIs here](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Neji)

These NEJIs are notated as if they were EDOs written using Kite's up and downs notation. However, you can copy & paste the `override()` declarations to any other standard EDO tuning configs to turn it into a NEJI.

This notation system showcases the use of `override()` declaration to state the specific cent offset of each unique note spelling in the tuning &mdash; which is used to configure notation systems where the tuning of an accidental depends on the nominal of the note it is being attached to & what other accidentals are present on the note.
