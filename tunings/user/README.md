# Userspace tuning configs

**ðŸŸ¢ Contains custom tuning configs created by users. One folder per user.**

Tunings saved/contributed in this directory will persist through plugin updates so you don't need to keep re-adding/copy-pasting them from another folder.

To contribute/modify the userspace, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/euwbah/musescore-xen-tuner/pulls) with git, or [file an issue](https://github.com/euwbah/musescore-xen-tuner/issues) with your tuning config that you wish to be added.
