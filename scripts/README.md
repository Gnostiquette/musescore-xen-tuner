# pyTen sKriPz

These scripts are not part of the plugin, but they are here to help make the development process easier by auto-generating repeated code and all that stuff.

These skripz are designed to run from the context of the project root.

That is, `pwd` should point to the `musescore-xen-tuner/` folder, instead of the `scripts/` folder.
